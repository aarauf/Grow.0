# Grow.0
Open source hardware and software for 21st century farming.

I'm going to use this to take some notes for the time being.

2/6/2016 - Took the last few days to put together the hardware for the first beta of Grow.0. Would like to mention that so far, contributed software dependencies include:
* DHTlib found on github and the arduino website: for the DHT temp/humidity sensor (AM2301).
* pyserial: to read and write serial data to the arduino board instead of the arduino IDE.
* LEMP: to host the Grow.0 intranet site and database.
* MySQL Connector/python: to connect python to the MySQL database.
